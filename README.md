# FULL STACK SITE (HELPING HAND)

This is a basic full stack website based on MERN

## Demo
Live: https://helpinghand-sp.netlify.app/ 

***This demo website is hosted in netlify.***
## API Reference

- API - hosted in vercel - `https://helphand.vercel.app/`
| METHOD | PARAMS | API                                             |
| :----- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| *GET*  |        | `https://helphand.vercel.app/cards?findtext=`   |
| *GET*  |  `id`  | `https://helphand.vercel.app/cards/id`          |
| *POST*  |       | `https://helphand.vercel.app/cards`             |

## Instructions:

- Clone repository from github 
- Install NPM - `npm i`
- On the front end, you can use APIs manually by changing the API URL with: `http://localhost:5000/`
- When it runs locally you can access the backend. But unfortunately, you need the MongoDB keys. I think it's better not to share it publicly

## I just made it easy for you by hosting the frontend on Netlify and the backend on Vercel. I hope the user experience is okay.
